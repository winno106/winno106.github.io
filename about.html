                <p>My name is Winno Philavanh. I am a sophmore at the University of Rhode Island and I am currently undecided.
      I hope to find a passion while exploring classes of possible interest so I can be on track will graduating. I have not yet
      found anything so far but going through CSC101, I really enjoyed it. I am taking CSC 106 which will be more about coding.
      I want to see if programming is something I want to do for my future career.<p>
