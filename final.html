        <h1> Final Project  </h1>
         
          <p>Introducing to you my final project for CSC106, it is a strafing game. You will use the<br>
            the direction keys, left and right arrow keys, to move your player away to avoid falling rocks<br>
            I was inspired by the frogger game to make this because it is a simply yet fun game to play<br>
            Enjoy!!<p>
